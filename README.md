# Udacity-Neighborhood-Map-Project

## Description

This web appplication is created as the project for Udacity Fullstack Web Developer nanodegree program, it is not meant for production.
The goal was to create a single page application that uses Google Maps API to display locations in a neighborhood of choice, so I decided to make a map of Amsterdam because it is a beautiful city.
We were also required to use another 3rd party API in order to retreive information about each location.
The code is separated using MVVM pattern provided by Knockout JS, so in the future it will be much easier to edit this project or add more features. As a 3rd party API, I have used Wikipedia API to give the user more information about each location on the map.

## Running the application

In order to successfully run this program, you can download this repository, or clone it.
Then you just have to open index.html file in your favorite browser and the application will run :)
Of course, internet access is required in order for application to run without any errors and connect to Google Maps API.
